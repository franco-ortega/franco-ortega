<p>
I'm a software engineer who loves to create intuitive interfaces and build out features across the stack. I appreciate well-documented and efficient processes that offer structure and flexibility. I value clear and kind communication, creativity, cross-functional collaboration, and supportive environments that foster diversity and nurture growth. Optimism guides my efforts while practicality ensures that my goals are brought to fruition.
